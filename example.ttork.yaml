# Example configuration file for the ttork application
#

# The k8s block is required for ttork to work properly
k8s:
  namespace: default # Specifies the namespace tilt wil deploy to
  context: kind-kind # Kubernetes context of your dev cluster

# Projects allows you to set the configuration for each one of your
# microservice development projects. Specifically, each refers to
# a specific Tiltfile configuration.
#
# At the very least, you must provide a project name, and tiltFilePath.
projects:
  # The name of the project. Does not have to be unique
  - name: Seeder

    # The path to the project's Tilt configuration file.
    # This must be unique to all projects within this configuration.
    tiltFilePath: /Users/awaller/waller_dev/projects/rcwl/seeder/Tiltfile

    # Optional environment variables can be set for each Tilt runtime
    # environment. Commonly used to specify a unique 'forward' port for
    # each application, making those environment variables available to
    # Tilt at the Tiltfile level.
    #
    # Any number of environment variables may be set here, and each environment
    # block is specific to the project it's nested under.
    environment:
      # In your Tiltfile, you could then access like so:
      # app_local_port = os.environ.get('APP_PORT', 8000)
      - name: APP_PORT
        value: "8080"
